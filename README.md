# [SDF06] Project: CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile

Welcome to the CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile project, where you'll get hands-on experience applying CSS layout concepts. In this project, we will have fun recreating a simplified version of an Instagram user profile page. You aim to practice using CSS for styling and layout to create a visually appealing and responsive web page.

This was a very challenging project for me, I couldn't seem to get my spacing right. I also couldn't figure out the hover effect of the likes and comments.
